# Assessment 1 

## Exemplar Response:

“My goal for this one-on-one is for my colleague to tell me their next action related to the PR comment. In this case after giving my feedback, pausing for wait time, and allowing them to ask questions, I will say “Tell me the next thing you’re going to do regarding the PR comments we discussed.” I will be listening for two things: 1) That the person will apologize to the colleague they offended; 2) edit the comment on the PR, whether or not the PR has been closed.”

## Scenario: 

You are wrapping up a weekly one-on-one with someone who reports directly to you. They have finished talking through their list of what’s gone well and poorly during the week, and you are wrapping up your feedback on their week. The most important thing that this person should understand is that in the next 24 hours, they need to alter the language they use in the comments section of a code review. During the last week, they unintentionally upset one of their colleagues by leaving a comment that said, ‘this code is really messy, you need to clean it up.’ You would like this developer apologize to their colleague, and to edit their comment so it is more neutral in tone and describes what the person requesting the review should change, something like, “This function is 28 lines long, and it performs multiple transformations on the input. Can you break this out into multiple functions, each of which only does one thing? Remember our engineering team quarterly goal of writing brief, modular functions.” 

## Tasks: 
1. Describe what want from your check for understanding. 
1. Show how you will you wrap up your feedback and Lock it In with this person.
